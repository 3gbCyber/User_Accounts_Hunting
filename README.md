# User Accounts Hunting

The Script helps you to know all users that has a folder in /home/ and give you some user info
Like creation time, Last login, UID, GID, passwd, and shadow.

These informations are values especially when you work as DFIR.

Usage:

``` sudo bash user.sh > result.csv ```

Example of the result:

NOTE: If you see the last user Khalid has no info which means the user is deleted but its folder is still there in /home/
