# User Accounts Hunting

The Script helps you to know all users that has a folder in /home/ and give you some user info
Like:

1- Created Time

2- Last Change Password

3- Last Login

4- User Status

5- UID

6- GID

7- Has Password?

8- Sudo Access

9- etc/passwd

These informations are values especially when you work as DFIR.

Usage:

``` sudo bash user.sh > result.csv ```

Example of the result:

NOTE: If you see the last user Khalid has no info which means the user is deleted but its folder is still there in /home/
